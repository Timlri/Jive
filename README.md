Accessing Jive analytics using R

Jive has several tools to access metadata pertaining to usage of Jive communities. This application examines 
recent unanswered questions posted to a Jive community and then acquires metadata (likes, bookmarks, views, etc.) 
about those questions. 
Ultimately the goal is to identify the latest "hot topics" in hopes of addressing the questions with a correct answer.
